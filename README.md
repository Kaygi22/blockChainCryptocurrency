# blockChainCryptocurrency
A small blockChain with JS
<br>
I was always curious about blockchain technologies, so I decided today to go throw it and set up a small blackchain for simple data, and the create a simple cryptocurrency app based on mining transactions between addresses that allows you to win some rewards.
<br>
The global main.js file contains the small cryptocurrency app.
<br>
The  simple secured blockchain folder contains the blockchain source code. It based on proof-of-work security method.
<br>
I tried to explain every single method and step by commenting my code.
<br>
Happy coding
