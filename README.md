# blockChainCryptocurrency
A small blockChain with JS

I was always curious about block chain technologies, so I decided today to go throw it and set up a small black chain for simple data, and the create a simple cryptocurrency app based on mining transactions between addresses in order to win some rewards.

The global main.js file contains the small cryptocurrency app.

On the other hand, there is a simple secured blockchain folder, which contain my block chain source code. It based on proof-of-work security method.

I tried to explain every single method and step by commenting my code.

Happy coding
